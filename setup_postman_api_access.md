# Setting Up Postman API Access for MCP

## Overview
To access your complete Postman workspace including all 7 collections mentioned, you need to set up the Postman API integration.

## Step 1: Get Postman API Key
1. Go to https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys
2. Click "Generate API Key"
3. Name it "Claude-MCP-Access"
4. Copy the API key

## Step 2: Find Your Workspace ID
1. Go to your Postman workspace
2. Look at the URL: `https://web.postman.co/workspace/[WORKSPACE-ID]/...`
3. Copy the workspace ID from the URL

## Step 3: Update Your MCP Configuration
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postman": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/jeangiet/Documents/postman-mcp-server3/mcpServer.js"],
      "env": {
        "POSTMAN_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_ID": "your-workspace-id-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Create Postman MCP Server
I can help you create a proper postman-mcp server that connects to the Postman API to access all your collections directly.

## Available Functions After Setup
- `list_collections()` - List all collections in workspace
- `get_collection(collection_id)` - Get complete collection with all requests
- `get_collection_requests(collection_id)` - Get all requests from a collection
- `search_requests(query)` - Search across all collections
- `get_workspace_info()` - Get workspace details

## Test Commands
Once set up, you can use these commands to verify access:
```bash
# List all collections
curl -X GET https://api.getpostman.com/collections \\
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"

# Get specific collection
curl -X GET https://api.getpostman.com/collections/collection-id \\
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

This will give you complete access to all 7 collections visible in your screenshot.
