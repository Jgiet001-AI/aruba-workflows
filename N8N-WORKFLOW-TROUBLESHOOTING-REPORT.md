- **Impact**: Complete credential compromise, unauthorized access potential

#### Resolution Implemented:
```json
// BEFORE (Vulnerable):
"value": "Bearer your-aruba-api-token"

// AFTER (Secure):
"authentication": "predefinedCredentialType",
"nodeCredentialType": "arubaApi"
```

**Security Improvements:**

- Established credential rotation procedures

#### Issue: Input Validation Vulnerabilities
- **Found in**: 18 workflows
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Details**: Missing validation for device IDs, SQL injection potential, XSS vulnerabilities

#### Resolution Implemented:
```javascript
// Enhanced input validation
const validateDeviceId = (deviceId) => {
  const pattern = /^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{3,50}$/;
  if (!pattern.test(deviceId)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid device_id format');
  }
  return String(deviceId).substring(0, 50);
};
```

### Priority 2: Workflow Structure Issues (RESOLVED)

#### Issue: Node Type Version Incompatibility
- **Found in**: 16 workflows
- **Risk Level**: BLOCKING
- **Details**: `typeVersion: 2.1`, `3.2`, `4.2` exceed supported versions, preventing workflow execution

#### Resolution Implemented:
```json
// BEFORE (Incompatible):
"typeVersion": 2.1

// AFTER (Compatible):
"typeVersion": 1.2
```

#### Issue: Missing Error Handling
- **Found in**: ALL workflows
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Details**: No Error Trigger nodes, missing error output connections, poor error recovery

#### Resolution Implemented:
- Added comprehensive error handling nodes to all workflows
- Implemented error output connections with proper routing
- Created centralized error notification system
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff

### Priority 3: Expression and Logic Issues (RESOLVED)

#### Issue: Nested Expression Complexity
- **Found in**: 8 workflows
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Details**: Complex nested expressions causing parsing failures and maintenance issues

#### Resolution Implemented:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Complex nested expression):
"text": "{{ $json.critical_devices > 0 ? 'ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**' : $json.warning_devices > 0 ? 'ðŸŸ¡ **WARNING**' : 'âœ… **HEALTHY**' }}"

// AFTER (Simplified with Code node):
const status = data.critical_devices > 0 ? 'CRITICAL' : 
               data.warning_devices > 0 ? 'WARNING' : 'HEALTHY';
return [{ json: { ...data, display_status: status } }];
